    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet Chili Popcorn Chicken is, quite literally, a “party in your mouth.” Each bite is coated in a toasted coconut-panko breading that's irresistibly crunchy and slightly sweet, perfectly balanced by a sticky-sweet chili glaze. And the kicker? They're baked—not fried—but you'd never guess it from the delicious texture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup panko</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>thinly sliced scallions</li>
        <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Chicken: Place panko and coconut on a large rimmed baking sheet and toss with 2 tablespoons oil to fully coat mixture. Spread into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a shallow dish and stir in cornstarch. Line the rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Stir together mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, ginger, garlic powder, salt, and onion powder in a medium bowl. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>In batches, toss chicken pieces in panko mixture, pressing to adhere and completely cover each piece; transfer coated pieces to prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Let sit 5 minutes to allow breading to set.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken pieces registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the coating is golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, flipping halfway through. Let sit 4 minutes before brushing with Sweet Chili Sauce.</li>
    </ol>
